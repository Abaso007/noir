This document outlines the process for creating and publishing a new release of Noir. It is intended for project maintainers.

## Release Channels

Noir is distributed through several channels. Some are updated automatically via GitHub Actions, while others require manual intervention.

| Channel | Package Name & Link | Release Process |
|---|---|---|
| Homebrew (Core) | [noir](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/noir) | Manual |
| Homebrew (Tap) | `owasp-noir/noir` | Automated |
| Snapcraft | [noir](https://snapcraft.io/noir) | Automated |
| Docker Hub | [ghcr.io/owasp-noir/noir](https://github.com/owasp-noir/noir/pkgs/container/noir) | Automated |
| OWASP Project Page | [OWASP/www-project-noir](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-noir) | Manual |

## General Procedure

1.  **Update Version**: Ensure the package version in the Noir source code and any relevant documentation has been updated.
2.  **Create GitHub Release**: Create a new release on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/owasp-noir/noir/releases). This will trigger the automated release workflows.
3.  **Manual Releases**: Follow the manual release procedures for any channels that are not automated.

## Manual Release Instructions

### Homebrew (Core)

To update the main Homebrew formula, you need to submit a pull request to the `homebrew-core` repository.

1.  **Fork and Sync**: Make sure you have a fork of the [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) repository and that it is up-to-date.
2.  **Run the Bump Command**: Use the `brew bump-formula-pr` command to automatically create a pull request with the new version.

    ```bash
    brew bump-formula-pr --strict --version <VERSION> noir
    # Example: brew bump-formula-pr --strict --version 0.22.0 noir
    ```

3.  **Style Check**: (Optional) To ensure your changes meet Homebrew's style guidelines, you can run:

    ```bash
    cd $(brew --repository)/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula
    brew style noir.rb
    ```

### OWASP Project Page

To update the OWASP project page, you need to submit a pull request to the `OWASP/www-project-noir` repository.

1.  **Fork and Sync**: Fork the [OWASP/www-project-noir](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-noir) repository and make sure it is up-to-date.
2.  **Update Content**: Make any necessary changes to the content of the project page.
3.  **Create Pull Request**: Create a pull request to the main repository.
