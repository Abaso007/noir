Noir is designed to be flexible and can be configured to match your specific workflow. Proper configuration can save you time and make the tool even more powerful.

In this section, you'll find information on:

*   **Shell Completions**: Set up autocompletion for your favorite shell (like Zsh, Bash, or Fish) to make running Noir commands faster and easier.
*   **Configuration Files**: Use a configuration file to save your most commonly used options and flags, so you don't have to type them out every time.

By taking a few moments to configure Noir, you can create a more efficient and personalized experience.
