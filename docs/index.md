## What is noir?

Noir is an open-source project dedicated to identifying attack surfaces, enhancing whitebox security testing, and optimizing security pipelines. It excels at discovering API endpoints, web endpoints, and other potential entry points within source code for comprehensive security analysis.

This tool was developed using [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org). Initially started as hahwul's personal project[^1] in August 2023, it became an OWASP project[^2] in June 2024, co-led by [hahwul](https://github.com/hahwul) and [ksg](https://github.com/ksg97031).

[^2]: [Welcome to OWASP Noir](https://github.com/orgs/owasp-noir/discussions/336)

## How it works?

Noir is composed of several key components: detector, analyzer, deliver, minilexer/miniparser[^3], output-builder, and passive-scan & tagger[^4]. These components interact and work together to effectively analyze source code. Through this process, they help identify endpoints, parameters, headers, and more within the source code.

[^3]: The minilexer and miniparser is a parser and tokenizer used for code analysis to identify various elements within the source code. 
[^4]: The tagger assigns relevant tags to the identified issues for easier categorization and management.
