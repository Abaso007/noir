### Setting up the Documentation Site

To set up the documentation site locally, follow these steps:

#### Install Dependencies

We use Rake tasks to manage dependencies. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
just docs-install # MODIFIED
```

#### Serve the Documentation Site

After installing the dependencies, you can serve the documentation site locally using the following Rake task:

```sh
just docs-serve # MODIFIED
```

This will start a local server, and you can view the documentation by navigating to http://localhost:4000 in your web browser.
